# One commit per day

One commit per day keeps the doctor away.

This repo was made to solve one problem each day in python. The problems I'm solving are very simple and I take them from [here](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

### Current goal
  - 30 days

### Contributing
I don't see the point in cloning or forking the repo, but I encourage you to start your own and set a goal of X days commiting.
