## One commit per day

###### One commit per day keeps the doctor away.

Now the goal is to make one commit each day but it doesn't need to solve a problem every day, just learning python.

First commits were solutions of Project Euler, so you can find a solution in each commit. Now I just commit simple scripts organized in folders (like `tools/` or `games/`)

### Current goal
  - 30 days

 - [Programming Challenges](http://www.programming-challenges.com/pg.php?page=studenthome)

### Building
I'm using `python2.7` so you don't need anything else.

### Contributing
I don't see the point in cloning or forking the repo, but I encourage you to start your own and set a goal of X days commiting. Also it would be nice to send me little problems to solve each day.
