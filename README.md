# One commit per day

One commit per day keeps the doctor away.

~~This repo was made to solve one problem each day in python. The problems I'm solving are very simple and take them from [here](https://projecteuler.net/archives). The solutions (to check results) can be found [here](http://www.s-anand.net/euler.html).~~ Now the goal is to make one commit each day but it doesn't need to solve a problem every day, just learning python.

### Current goal
  - 30 days

### Contributing
I don't see the point in cloning or forking the repo, but I encourage you to start your own and set a goal of X days commiting.
